            <dd>Like small whales, dolphins are sea mammals that breathe air through a hole in their backs. They use special sounds to communicate and to find their food.</dd>

            </br>
            <dt>LOBSTER</dt>
            <dd>Like the crab and shrimp, the lobster's skeleton is on the outside of its body. A lobster can even live to be 50 years old - if not caught.</dd>

            </br>
            <dt>PORCUPINE FISH</dt>
            <dd>When this fish is in danger, it gulps water and inflates like a balloon, its sharp scales then point straight out showing that it will not make a nice snack!</dd>

            </br>
            <dt>STARFISH</dt>
            <dd>These creatures come in many colors, and many have between 5 and 40 arms. If it loses an arm, a new one will grow right back!</dd>

            </br>
            <dt>WALRUS</dt>
            <dd>This Artic animal can weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1, 360kg). Walruses live in herds of 100 or more animals. Their tusks are thought to be mainly used to pull themselves up onto pieces of ice.</dd>
